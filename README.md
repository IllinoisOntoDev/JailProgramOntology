### An Ontology for Jail Programs

Several jail programs and services are available for current and former incarcerated people. These programs range from pretrial incarceration alternatives to post-custody support, span different focus areas (e.g. employment, mental health), and are managed by different types of organizations. The Illinois Department of Corrections has education, substance abuse, counseling, re-entry, and veteran transition programs in the Champaign County Jail [3, 4], but there are also programs run by volunteer organizations such as the Urbana Champaign Books to Prisoners .

From my research, I found no available online resource that lists all available jail programs and services. This is crucial information that can be used to evaluate the current resources and need of inmates. As such, I propose to develop an ontology to streamline the descriptions of jail programs. Many programs have similar focuses and goals, and developing an ontology that standardizes these descriptions and classifies the programs is beneficial in many aspects. It paves the way for the creation of a central database containing information on the various programs, while allowing the maintenance of the records to be decentralized. By allowing the process of record management to the organization overseeing the program, which likely knows more about the program, the descriptions can be more accurate.

The main purpose of the ontology is to allow organizations to provide general descriptions of their jail programs. The main question that will drive this ontology development is “What jail programs are available in Champaign County?”. It will be designed using information from current programs, but it will be flexible for extensions in both adding more types of programs (breadth) and adding more specific details (depth).

The following questions should be answerable through this ontology:
* How many inmates are part of program X?
* Which programs are inmate X part of?
* Which programs are ideal for a specific inmate?

As well as following broader policy questions:
* Are the needs of the inmates being addressed?
* Are there enough programs in Champaign County?

This ontology is only to describe the programs. Descriptions of assessments and outcomes of these programs are out of the scope of this initial domain ontology development. The ontology allows tracking of which inmates are currently in which programs, but does not provide detailed descriptions of time frame or whether inmates changed or completed programs. More detailed descriptions of the organizations, such as number of staff, are also outside the scope.

Although this ontology will be developed specifically for jail programs, this can also integrate with prison programs. This ontology can be slightly modified or extended to also account for prison programs since there is a clear link between these two criminal justice divisions. A jail inmate who has mental health needs and has been sentenced will likely also have mental health needs in prison.

In its 2013 Criminal Justice System Assessment [2], the Institute for Law & Policy Planning recommended that the Champaign County improve its data collection and evaluation capabilities. This ontology help the Champaign County Board achieve this goal. It provides a standard to describe programs as well as inference capabilities to assist in evaluating the needs of jail inmates as well as the availability of resources.

The initial list of class and properties of the jail program domain, shown in page 5, was designed using information from [1], [3] and [5], as well as the programs mentioned above.
